## Insights & Recommendations

### Insights
- Delhi NCR and the 31–40 age group are top contributors:
    - 11K customers and ₹401M revenue from Delhi NCR
    - 4.7K customers and ₹146M revenue from age group 31–40
- Offline-Agent is the highest performing sales mode with:
    - 15K customers (55%) and ₹551M revenue (56%)
    - Top-performing channel by far
- March 2023 saw a major spike in Customers (7.1K) and revenue (264M) — likely campaign-driven or due to channel pushes POL4321HEL is the most preferred policy:
    - Over 4.4K policies sold, most popular among ages 31–50
- Settlement expectation rises with age:
    - 65+ Age group expects 71.16% but has lowest participation (1.9K customers)
- Online channels (App + Website) together account for ₹286M revenue and 7K customers — important but still far behind Offline-Agent

### Recommendations
- Focus on Offline-Agent channel — it’s your best performer in both revenue and customer count.
- Promote in Delhi NCR and to 31–40 age group, since they bring the highest value.
- Understand what worked in March and try to repeat that success in future months.
- Push POL4321HEL more, especially to mid-age customers who already like it.
- Educate and target senior citizens (65+) — they expect more but aren't engaged enough.
- Improve Online channels (App & Website) to grow faster and catch up with offline sales.
